# Running your self

You do not really need to run my script your self unless you're adding functionality (to pull request back hopefully) because the stats I commit into the repo should be up to date.

If you're interested in pull requesting additions these commands might be useful:

```
source venv/bin/activate ; pip install -r requirements.txt
python hotslogslogs.py
git diff wiki/
```
