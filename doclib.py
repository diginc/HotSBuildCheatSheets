Here are the most popular Hero of the Storm Heros' builds from [HOTS Logs](https://www.hotslogs.com/Default) in a **shorthand format**.

    '''## Shorthand Explained
* The actual number is the number of talents down from the top of that tier's talent list.
* Left to right are level tiers, in order, with the Heroic between dashes (Levels 1,4,7, dash, 10, dash, 13, 16, 20)
    My shorthand format is each talent tier gets represent by a number, that number is the number of choices down from the first talent for that tier.  I group the tier talent numbers symmetrically with the first 3 levels and last 3 bunched up, and level 10 with dashes around it.  See the example at the bottom if this is confusing or click through to the hero pages.

    '''## Shorthand Example
E.G. ToughGuy: 321-2-524 shorthand build means ToughGuy's build goes like this

Tier | Level | Talent Choice From top
---- | ----- | ------
 1   |  1    | 3rd talent choice from top
 2   |  4    | 2nd talent
 3   |  7    | 1st talent
 4   | 10    | 2nd talent
 5   | 13    | 5th talent
 6   | 16    | 2nd talent
 7   | 20    | 4th talent

    '''## Why?
This is a project I made solely for myself and to save time since I used to manually create shorthand character build cheat sheets.  Quickly choosing talents in game is important, even when you're not as familiar with a character's talents.  I assume there are some other new players that could benefit from this type of thing so I've shared this information through github.

    '''## How?
HOTS Logs Log is a simple python scraper, feel free to browse the sourcecode in the github project.  I asked for permission before scraping HotSLogs and do so only once a day (and republish the latest info on this project's github wiki pages)
